# technicalproject
My technical project is a folder containing a pdf writeup of a problem set assigned by a class I am
currently taking at MIT, Computational Cognitive Science. The problem set itself consists of
three questions: The first revolves around creating a model to assess human intuition on
whether a sequence has been generated by a fair or unfair coin, the second around predicting
the general hypothesis space from a randomly chosen subset, and the third around Comparing
posterior and predictive medians on predictive observed lifespans with a Power law prior vs.
Gaussian prior. Additionally included are three code files, each relating to the problem with the
matching name. These files can be found on this GitHub.
